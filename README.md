# GoalBuddy
A web app that helps you track your goals with friends. The inspiration for this project idea came from my dealings with my accountability partner. Basically, it's just to help users stay abreast with their goals while being accountable to others.

## Upcoming features
- Ability to create an account (obviously).
- Ability to create groups and join groups. A user can be in multiple groups. See a group as a set of users (ideally friends or a team).
- Ability to add tasks/goals, keep track of them and also view other teammates tasks.
- Receive reminders in form of emails when tasks deadlines is close
- Ability to set when the reminder gets sent.
